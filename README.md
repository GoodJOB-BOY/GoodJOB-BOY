# 📚 My Research 📚
This study explores the use of **Google BERT's** language recognition to identify the authenticity of product reviews for consumer goods on Amazon, focusing on categories like home goods, electronics, clothing, toys, and pet supplies. By training the model and combining it with web crawling, fake reviews are filtered out. The **LDA topic model** is then used to analyze the filtered data. The research identifies frequently repeated vocabulary and a lack of detailed information, which complicates topic identification. Sentiment analysis shows a strong positive bias in reviews. These findings confirm that fake reviews often feature repetitive vocabulary, vague details, and extreme language. BERT's language model proves effective in detecting fake reviews.  
- Using **Google BERT** for **modeling**, **parameter tuning**, and **fine-tuning**
- Using **Selenium** to collect large-scale textual data
- Using **LDA topic** model analyze the filtered data
